## Conclusion
In 2018, analysts sounded the alarm when Army recruitment numbers were not met for the first time in over a decade. On closer inspection, it turned out 71 percent of American youth did not meet minimum enlistment standards due to obesity, previous criminal records, and lack of education. Recruitment and retention numbers for all services recovered in the following years, and the services met their fiscal year 2021 goals. In 2022, however, all service branches are

struggling to meet recruitment targets, most likely due to the highly competitive civilian US job market.

While acknowledging that manpower supply is a serious concern, this article has argued that the notion of a “manpower crisis” needs to be nuanced. Although the relatively small recruitment pool of qualified youth remains a serious challenge for the armed forces, the underlying issues of obesity, previous criminal records, and lack of education may, to various degrees, be worked around. Nor do all of these issues trend in the wrong direction, particularly when it comes to the educational attainment of young Americans.

The Department of Defense has historically found ways to overcome manpower shortfalls.<sup>58</sup> First, the Armed forces have used more contractors at home and abroad. Contractors are less expensive and easier to recruit and terminate. The US military has adopted a practice empoyed by private companies for a long time—outsourcing certain activities that do not need a highly skilled workforce. Outsourcing is problematic since the practice makes the military dependent on a private sector driven by different incentives than the public sector. Second, reservists have been used more efficiently—and could be used even more efficiently if appropriately managed.

Third, the number of Department of Defense civilians has increased. Over time, the military has shifted active-duty personnel functions to other workforces to overcome recruitment and retention problems because active-duty servicemembers are expensive. Although much of the discussion focuses on recruitment, some analysts think retention is a more significant concern since it is easier for the military to mask the numbers. Some believe the most talented people tend to leave and continue their careers elsewhere.<sup>59</sup>

Finally, in light of the Biden-Harris administration’s prevailing focus on China, there is pressure to prioritize technological modernization over a force structure increase. Russia’s war in Ukraine may delay but will not fundamentally change the long overdue pivot to Asia. The Marine Corps has led the way in this respect and adopted a future vision based on a conflict scenario in the South China Sea. Additionally, US leadership needs to focus on implementing better talent management systems within the military that bolster the quality rather than quantity of servicemembers. Although these actions are necessary for improvement, in comparison to Russia and China, the future US recruitment pool in the long-term looks good. While complacency about manpower challenges is never

a virtue, there should be no significant problems recruiting a sufficiently large force in the medium- to long-term.
