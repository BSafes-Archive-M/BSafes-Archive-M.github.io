## Recruitment and Retention
Recruitment and retention are core concerns for staffing organizations, including militaries. Much of the discussion of manpower challenges facing the US military focuses on recruitment rather than retention. In the last few years, retention goals have mostly been met or exceeded, and retaining personnel is, therefore, usually considered less of an issue than recruitment—except for female retention, which is considerably lower than male retention.<sup>4</sup>

Applicant numbers increased dramatically following 9/11, and the 2008 economic recession further bolstered these numbers. Then, combat operations were gradually cut back in Iraq and then Afghanistan, reducing the number of recruits needed.<sup>5</sup> In 2018, however, the Army failed to meet its recruitment target for the first time since 2005, when the Iraq War was at its peak, and there was widespread talk of an emerging “manpower crisis” in the Army.<sup>6</sup> This failure, which likely resulted from the booming US economy at the time, provoked debate within the Army about future recruitment efforts. While all service branches reached their 2020 and 2021 targets, many believe this achievement was due to the weak

COVID-19 afflicted economy.<sup>7</sup>  In the competitive 2022 job market, all service branches experienced difficulties meeting recruitment targets, raising alarms about the challenges of maintaining a large enough force.<sup>8</sup>

From the quality of applicants to the state of the economy, many factors impact recruitment numbers. First, scholars have observed a strong correlation between unemployment and higher recruitment and retention. In a strong economy, there are naturally more options for people considering leaving the armed forces.<sup>9</sup> Hence, some analysts believe the uncertain post–COVID-19 economy may provide fertile ground for military recruiters.<sup>10</sup> Second, the total pool the military recruits from is small. Moreover, awareness of what a military career entails among youth is limited; 50 percent of youth claim to “know little” about serving in the US military.<sup>11</sup> Studies have shown that approximately 136,000 individuals of the 33-million Americans between 17 and 24 meet the minimum enlistment standards and express a willingness to serve. According to 2017 Pentagon data, over 70 percent of Americans between 17 and 24 are ineligible to serve in the military—meaning 24 million individuals from the 33-million pool do not meet miimum enlistment requirements.12 A 2018 Heritage Foundation report described these numbers as an “alarming situation which threatens the country’s fundamental national security.”13 The main reasons for ineligibility were lack of education, previous criminal records, and obesity.

Many eligible recruits are from military families, which opponents of the all-volunteer force feared would happen. They believe this tendency led to the

unintended creation of an American “warrior caste.”<sup>14</sup> So-called “professional inheritance” is not exclusive to the military. Many occupations display similar tendencies, such as US police forces. However, 2015 Department of Defense data indicated that over 25 percent of new recruits have a parent who previously served in the military.<sup>15</sup> In itself, professional inheritance is not a problem, but it could become one if the appearance of a “family business” impedes efforts to reach new demographics.

When assessing the current state of recruitment, military leadership should consider trends likely to impact the recruiting pool in the medium- to long-term future. First, there does not seem to be much cause for alarm regarding high-school completion rates, and there are few reasons to believe the situation will deteriorate further. The National Center for Education Statistics reports the graduation rate for public high-school students in 2018 was 85 percent—the highest rate since it was first measured in 2010–11.<sup>16</sup> Although the federal government has a limited role in the education system, the Biden-Harris administration invests heavily in school districts with a higher proportion of low-income students, which should encourage the positive trend in high-school graduation rates.<sup>17</sup>

Second, the number of Americans with criminal records is high—as many as one in three US adults is estimated to have a criminal record.18 The service branches often grant waivers for minor offenses, and over time, the percentage of waivers has closely reflected recruitment needs.

Third, unlike education and criminal records, obesity is not improving, particularly in the southern United States, which provides a disproportionally large number of recruits.19 There are strategies, however, to help potential recruits deal with obesity. Local recruitment offices often run informal fitness camps to
