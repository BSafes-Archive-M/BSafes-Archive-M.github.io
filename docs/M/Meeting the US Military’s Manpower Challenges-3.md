## Domestic Polarization and Manpower Challenges
A tendency toward polarization may be understood as foundational to the US political system, which combines a majoritarian electoral system with strong support for minority interests. To fully comprehend the challenges of a rapidly diversifying population, one needs to examine how the military has been impacted by increased domestic polarization in recent decades. Many Democratic voters moved to the left. In what a Vox journalist called “a Great Awokening,” White Democrats have changed their political preferences to the left over the last few years, especially in terms of social justice issues such as race.<sup>29</sup> Political scientist Lilliana Mason has shown how a variety of social, economic, religious, and racial cleavages have aligned themselves into a simple binary—Republican or Democrat. She argues Donald Trump’s election may be understood as “the culmination of a long process by which the American electorate has become deeply divided along partisan lines.”<sup>30</sup> By the end of Trump’s presidency, analysts at the Pew Research Center concluded “Americans have rarely been as polarized as they are today.”<sup>31</sup>

The controversies surrounding the military’s diversity initiatives must be understood within the context of an increasingly polarized society. The most

controversial parts of diversity initiatives are wholly or partly based on critical race theory (CRT).<sup>32</sup> A slide with information on “white privilege,” a key concept within critical race theory, was included in a 2015 diversity training session at Fort Gordon, Georgia, drawing criticism. An Army spokesperson immediately backtracked and said that the slide’s content was not authorized.<sup>33</sup> The Trump administration banned federal diversity training based on CRT precepts in September 2020, and the service branches then canceled contracts with contractors who provided diversity training based on critical race theory.

Critical race theory, however, continued to gain traction in an increasingly polarized domestic setting. On his first day in office, Biden rescinded the ban, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III issued a memo instructing the armed forces to resume CRT-based diversity training.<sup>34</sup> Scattered reports of pushback started to appear shortly after the memo’s release. For instance, a high-profile incident erupted around the incorporation of critical race theory in workshops on equity, diversity, and inclusion conducted at the United States Military Academy. In April 2021, Congressman Mike Waltz (Florida Sixth Congressional District) sent a letter to Lieutenant General Darryl A. Williams, superintendent of the United States Military Academy, characterizing this training as “inflammatory” and “detrimental to the mission and morale of the U.S. Army.”<sup>35</sup> Some commentators and members of Congress have gone so far as to speak of a “woke military.”<sup>36</sup>

The high degree of contestation surrounding military diversity initiatives presents challenges for recruitment efforts. The military needs to remain an attractive career choice for minorities since the US population is rapidly diversifying. Therefore, recruiters are actively attempting to attract minorities. Although recent data on political preference within the military is lacking, available research suggests conservatives are overrepresented within the military, particularly among officers.<sup>37</sup> Given the polarized public, one may suspect some

officers are put off by too strident a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, as seen in recent controversies surrounding diversity training based on critical race theory, which some observers believe could be harmful to military effectiveness.<sup>38</sup> Others are concerned diversity initiatives, to the extent that they involve informal quotas or “soft” affirmative-action programs, would undermine the military’s strict meritocratic system.<sup>39</sup> The military will need to balance the appeal to ethnic and racial minorities while not alienating rural Southern and more conservative Americans who have traditionally been its largest recruiting pool.
