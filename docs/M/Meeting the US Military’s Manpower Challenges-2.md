## Shifting Demographics and Manpower Challenges
Although the military has found ways to address current challenges, the United States is experiencing rapid demographic shifts that will raise new issues. The US Census Bureau projects that the United States will become “minority white” around 2045, meaning the white population will constitute less than 50 percent of the total population.<sup>21</sup> As a result, future military ranks will be more racially and ethnically diverse. In response to these projections, the Department of Defense implemented various diversity initiatives that have been debated for decades. Addressing diversity and inclusivity within the armed forces is “a strategic imperative,” with implications for the future ability to carry out grand strategy.<sup>22</sup> A growing emphasis on diversity in all US sectors has also impacted the armed forces.

The military has made significant progress in diversifying its workforce overall, and the composition of all active-duty personnel closely reflects the ethnic/racial composition of the US population.<sup>23</sup> The senior officer corps, however, is still significantly less diverse than the US population. Moreover, the majority of recruits come from middle-class backgrounds, and are not disproportionately recruited among poor Americans, as observers critical of US foreign policy sometimes claim.<sup>24</sup> Women remain underrepresented at all levels (around 16 percent), and ethnic and racial minorities are underrepresented at higher ranks.<sup>25</sup> As of May 2018, Black Americans made up 16.8 percent of active-duty personnel, with a total share of 13.7 percent of the US resident

population ages 18 to 64.<sup>26</sup> In the officer corps only, Black representation decreases to 8.1 percent. Within the top echelons of the armed forces (generals/flag officers), Black representation amounts to 8 percent. When examining the top 41 most senior commanders (four-star ranking) in 2021, two are Black, and one is a woman.<sup>27</sup> Under Joe Biden’s presidency, the Department of Defense has prioritized diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to ensure the military remains an attractive career choice for minorities.<sup>28</sup> When it comes to female retention, momentum is building in Congress to change how the military deals with sexual violence within the services. These potential changes may facilitate the retention and recruitment of women. Whether such efforts will yield tangible results remains to be seen.
