**ABSTRACT:** Concerns raised over the impact of changing demographics, domestic polarization, and the return of near-peer competition on US military manpower challenges are overstated. Drawing on open-source materials and interviews, this article discusses factors often neglected in conversations on this topic and provides leadership and policymakers with a scholarly overview of an important yet understudied issue facing the US armed forces.

### Key words: manpower, demographic change, domestic polarization, near-peer competition, US armed forces

The question of whether the manpower needs of the Armed Forces might be solved with volunteers has been debated since the draft was abolished and the all-volunteer force (AVF) introduced as US operations in Vietnam began winding down in the early 1970s. The Gates Commission, which examined the implications of moving to an all-volunteer force, raised concerns about ending the draft. Would a career military become increasingly isolated from the rest of US society? Would this isolation lead to a military unrepresentative of the US population in terms of class and race? Consequentially, would the broader public become less interested in US foreign and security affairs?<sup>1</sup> Moreover, Samuel Huntington famously argued that civilian control would be harder to assert if a military organization is not representative of its population.<sup>2</sup> Over the years, experts and pundits have addressed these concerns by arguing that reinstating the draft is the best way to meet future manpower needs.<sup>3</sup> Doing so is unpopular and unlikely to happen.

Nevertheless, manpower remains a central issue for the US military. In 2018, the Army failed to meet its recruitment target for the first time since 2005, when the Iraq War was at its peak, and there was widespread talk of an emerging “manpower crisis” in the Army and the military at large. Unlike strategy and weapon systems

questions, manpower issues remain understudied in the scholarly community. This article examines the current manpower challenges in the US military within the context of changing demographics, increased domestic polarization, and a change in strategic focus to near-peer competition. It argues that the long-term manpower supply is not the crisis others have made it out to be despite the issues first raised in 2018 and the additional problems arising from an increasingly polarized public. The projected 2050 recruitment pool is sufficient to meet the Army’s needs, and the Army should focus on modernization and investment in high-end technologies to meet the challenges posed by near-peer competition with China and Russia.

This article examines the main factors influencing recruitment and retention numbers, the changing demographic facing the US military, the significance of domestic polarization, and the manpower challenges caused by the strategic shift to near-peer competition. The final section summarizes the main findings.
