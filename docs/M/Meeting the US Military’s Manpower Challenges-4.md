## Near-Peer Competition
The shift from focusing on anti-terrorist operations and counterinsurgency (COIN) to near-peer competition with China and Russia raises new manpower challenges. As the *2018 National Defense Strategy* observed: “[i]nter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.”<sup>40</sup> This concern remains in the *2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance* and the *2022 National Defense Strategy.* China and Russia, however, are struggling with low birth rates that will affect their projected pool of recruits in 2050. In 2050, the United States will have an estimated total recruitment pool (ages 15 to 24) of 44 million people, compared to 138 million in China and 14.6 million in Russia.<sup>41</sup> Given the total size of the US military has remained stable since the end of the Cold War, these numbers, while important to monitor carefully, should not cause concern.<sup>42</sup>

Further, the strategic focus on near-peer competition with China calls for investment in expensive technologies rather than expanding conventional armies.<sup>43</sup> With Russia, though, strategists see the need for retaining large conventional armies. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, some observers argued for an increased permanent presence of US troops in Eastern Europe.<sup>44</sup> As Mark Cancian pointed out, the scenarios considered most likely in great-power conflict do not require large conventional ground forces. The Pacific

theater consists mostly of oceans, and the geographical features involved in an attack on the Baltic countries would make it difficult to deploy large numbers of US ground forces.<sup>45</sup> In addition, many US strategists believe Europeans should assume more responsibility for their defense, freeing up American resources for Asia.

To pay for expensive technologies, many strategists favor a reduction in force size.<sup>46</sup> In light of the strategic focus on China, the different service branches are adopting their own approaches. Since the Navy and Air Force are likely to play the most important roles in a conflict with China, the Army is likely to shrink. The Army, however, would play a critical role in a conflict with Russia. At the same time, it is trying to develop capabilities that will also be useful in the Pacific theater, such as long-range anti-ship missiles.<sup>47</sup> Even when large numbers of ground combat troops are not needed, the Army has historically provided large numbers of troops to support other services.

The Air Force will likely cut its force to finance modernization efforts. The Marine Corps is currently restructuring its forces (Force Design 2030) for the Pacific theater.<sup>48</sup> It plans to shrink to pre-Iraq and pre-Afghanistan levels to pay for long-range precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles.<sup>49</sup> The Navy, for some time, has been perceived as an outlier because it plans to grow its force structure and increase its fleet considerably, though its earlier goal of reaching a 355-ship fleet collapsed due to staggering costs.<sup>50</sup> Although Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may delay the long overdue pivot to Asia, the future focus on China will require modernization and investment in high-end technologies rather than large numbers of troops.

Analysts agree the biggest challenge for the armed forces in an age of nearpeer competition is the *quality* rather than the quantity of servicemembers.<sup>51</sup> Recruiting and retaining personnel with high-end technical and cyber skills, (since the cyber domain is projected to increase rapidly) must be a priority. The *2018 National Defense Strategy* highlights the necessity to modernize professional

military education (PME), implement improved talent management, and better utilize civilian workforce expertise.<sup>52</sup> In May 2020 the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a vision and guidance for professional military educatoin and talent management, noting “[t]he return of great power competition raises the stakes for readiness and for innovation.”<sup>53</sup> The document acknowledges the US military must prepare for facing adversaries, which may outnumber US forces and possess technologies equal to the United States, and provides a vision for a continuous PME and talent management system that produces leaders who “achieve intellectual overmatch against adversaries.”<sup>54</sup>

Prioritizing talent management is essential from a manpower perspective since it makes the military a more attractive employer and helps recruitment and retention. For some years, a better talent management system has been discussed.<sup>55</sup> Essentially, the armed forces face the problem of moving from an industrial-era model for labor force management, where individuals are interchangeable, to a talent management model, where management must consider the particular skills and knowledge of each individual.<sup>56</sup> The Army has been using an online marketplace—the Army Talent Alignment Process (ATAP)—for several years. Officers may easily see available assignments for which they are qualified, rankorder their preferences, and upload their CVs. The system gives users recruiting and designing PME programs a better overview of needed skills.<sup>57</sup> While more work is needed to improve talent management, its higher prioritization may enhance personnel retention.
